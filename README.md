# Mouse-A-Sketch

Take a good look at `index.html` and `style.css` and make sure you understand what both are doing. You will be working in `app.js`.

**Goal:**

Can you build a basic etch-a-sketch?

A visitor to your site should be able to "draw" with their mouse, simply by moving their cursor around the screen. They should also be able to "pick" a color, using the HTML5 colorpicker.

**Solution**

You can find a basic solution to this exercise in the [solution branch](https://github.com/nathanallen/mouse-a-sketch/tree/solution) of this repo.
